<p class="classDesc"><b>HIST 113: </b>This was a great class. I thought I had learned enough about the American Revolution and The Civil War in high school but I was very wrong. In this class we went much deeper and I learned a lot of new things and had a good time.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 476: </b>Certainly one of the hardest classes I have taken in my life. The content was super interesting but the homework was tough. I learned a lot about my ability to stay persistent when things get tough. I also learned just how great of a resource the Professor can be during office hours to help me out. In the end I got through the class and I am glad I took it. With this class done I am close to finishing up the math major.  </p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 203X: </b>This class was a pass/fail only class that was basically like being in a club. We had a Professor oversee us as we spent the first few classes preparing to compete in the Nation Cyber League (NCL). The main part of the competition was the Fall Regular Season. Here is my <a href="Keith_NCL_Participation.pdf"> Participation Certificate</a> and <a href="Keith_NCL_ScoutingReport.pdf"> Scouting Report</a> from the fall regular season. This ethical hacking stuff is probably the thing Iâ€™ve had the most fun in with computing. As of now my dream job would be in computer security. </p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 389: </b>In this class we got together in groups of three and all decided on a independent project to work on for the semester. My group members and I decided to learn about Cryptography. We knew nothing about it and we dove in and learned some new things. Here is a <a href="cs389.html"> link</a> to the page where I tracked our progress throughout the semester and here is the <a href="Keith_Group_Crypto_Poster.pdf"> final poster</a> that we created.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>ENGL 116W: </b>Another amazing class. Had no idea what I was getting into and this class really challenged me with the reading and discussions. I learned a lot and am very glad I had this experience.</p>
