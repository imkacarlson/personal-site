<h3>Class Schedule:</h3>
<p class="dayWeek">Monday, Wednesday, Friday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>9:10 - 10:10 am: GERM 231 Intermediate German I</li>
	<li>10:20 - 11:20 am: CS 451 Topics in Computer Science: Automata Theory</li>
	<li>11:30 am - 12:30 pm: CS 451 Lab</li>
	<li>1:50 - 2:50 pm: MATH 476 Modern Geomertey</li>
</ul>

<p class="dayWeek">Tuesday, Thursday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>12:50 - 2:20 pm: MATH 253 Linear Alegbra</li>
</ul>

<p class="classDesc"><b>GERM 231: </b>Just moving through the German once class at a time. I have the same Professor I have always had so that is nice to have.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 451: </b>It was interesting to take a theory based computer science class.  I learned a lot of new things so that was cool.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 476: </b>This was a big step up in level of math. I was overwhelmed at first but then started to figure things out. It was a really fun class, we had a small class and one of the highlights was that at the end of the semester we went to a local high school and presented on some of the things that we learned.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 253: </b>Fun class, it took some time for me to balance my homework load with this being my second math class but after getting settled I got into a good system that worked. Completing this class and the geometry one puts on me on a good track for not only a math minor but also a math major. I am thinking this point I am going to double major in both Math and Computer Science!</p>

<h3>Class Schedule:</h3>
<p class="dayWeek">Monday, Wednesday, Friday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>9:10 - 10:10 am: GERM 232 Intermediate German II</li>
	<li>11:30 am - 12:30 pm: ANTH 150 Controversies/Issues: Cultural Anthropology</li>
	<li>1:50 - 2:50 pm: CS 353 Architecture and Compilers</li>
	<li>3:00 - 4:00 pm: CS 353 Lab</li>
</ul>

<p class="dayWeek">Tuesday, Thursday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>9:40 - 11:10 am: MATH 376 Topic: Graph Theory</li>
</ul>

<p class="classDesc"><b>GERM 232: </b>Last German class. Going to miss it a bit but I do not really have space to take more German now that I want to double major in math and computer science.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>ANTH 150: </b>This was an out of the blue super fun class. I have really enjoyed these random liberal arts classes and this one did not disappoint! For our final project we had to visit a new place and write about it. I choose to attend church for a few weeks at a local Quaker church and that was especially very interesting.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 353: </b>This was a fun class, I learned a lot more about how computers work and operate on a low level. After this class it is crazy to see how "high-level" Java really is.</p>
<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 376: </b>This class was insane! It was so much fun and so much work. The stuff was really interesting during lectures in class but some of the problems were really tough for me. For some reason the methods for solving proofs in Graph Theory did not come naturally for me. I would work really long on a problem only to find out I am going in the wrong direction. I learned to utilize the Professor for questions as much as possible and I was able to get through it. Overall I enjoyed it I have just never had a class be so challenging for me as this.</p>

<p class="center_text">I also officially declared a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at the end of this school year! Very exciting!</p>
