No better way to end the season then a trip to nationals! Both the guys and girls teams qualified and I was so grateful to get this experience as a freshman. The men's team finished 28th in the nation and the women 10th!</p>

<p class="center_text">I did not run track in high school so this was my first ever track season. It was a great new experience. I focused mostly on the 5,000 meter run and the 3,000 meter steeplechase.</p>

<p class="center_text">Antoher great season. I set a new personal best in the 8k and we defended our team title at the Northwest Conference Cross Country Championships. I finished 8th in the conference and once again earned 2nd team all-conference honors.</p>

<p class="center_text">It was great to go into this season knowing what to expect being my second track season. I continued with my events from last year running the 3,000 meter steeplechase and 5k. I was fortunate to make the travel team and going to San Francisco and Chicago were some of the highlights of the season. I set new Personal Records in both the steeple and 5k and improved upon my finishes from last year at conference meet.</p>

<p class="center_text">I had my best ever summer of training before the season and the hard work paid off! Unlike the past two years I ran really strong on the postseason races this year. I took 2nd place individually at the Northwest Conference XC Championships and led our team to our 6th straight conference team title. Then at the Regional Championships in Calaremont, CA I finished 15th individually and earned a individual bid to the national meet.</p>

<p class="center_text">Nationals was held at Principia College in Elsah, Illionis. It was a lot of fun, I did not race as well as I would have liked finishing 188th but I got some invaluable experience racing at this level.</p>
