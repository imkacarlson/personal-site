<p class="dayWeek">Tuesday, Thursday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>11:30 - 12:30: IDS 101X Colloquium Compass</li>
</ul>

<p class="classDesc"><b>GERM 131: </b>I took two years of Spanish in high school but that was freshman and sophomore year so I do not think I could have tested out of any of the language requirements. I decided to take German just because it seemed new and fun. It ended up going well I think the coolest part was learning a lot about German culture.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 152/153: </b>I decided to take this math class because it is required for the Computer Science major. I am certain I want to major in computer science and I want to get the math out of the way ASAP so why not start now. The toughest part of this class was that it was Accelerated it was basically two classes in one semester so when normal midterms were going on we were having out final for 152 and a quarter of the way into the semester we had our midterm. It was a big change from High School but I enjoyed the challenge.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 141: </b>I want to major in Computer Science so this is the first step! I had taken AP Computer Science in high school but taking an intro class again was beyond helpful. The professor was great and I learned so many new things. </p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>IDS 101: </b>This is a required thing for all incoming freshman at Willamette. We got to choose Colloquium topics that seemed interesting and they would put us in one of our five choices. I don't think Genres of the Self was on the top of my list, I donâ€™t even remember selecting it. I was nervous about how it would turn out. All of my nervousness quickly went away because this class was so much fun. I had a blast. We learned about different ways we form our identities and the readings were all interesting and the Professor was phenomenal. Great class.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 141 Lab: </b>Each Computer Science class has a lab. In lab we work on our homework and can get help from the Professor, fellow classmates, and a TA. Really nice to have this because I could get my homework done most of the time.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>IDS 101X: </b>This was a quarter credit pass fail class that was just meant as a resource for freshman to get help. We went over important things like how to register for classes and such. It was nice to have this. We occasionally had readings and stuff and we learned about what a liberal arts education means.</p>

<p class="dayWeek">Tuesday, Thursday</p>
<ul class="class_schedule">
	<li>9:40 - 11:10: REL 116 Intro to Major Religious Texts </li>
</ul>

<p class="classDesc"><b>GERM 132: </b>Continuing the path of German, after this I am halfway there. (2 years of language required to graduate).</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>CS 241: </b>Also continuing along the computer science path. This was a really fun class. Intro prepared me well and now I was diving into completely new stuff.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>MATH 251W: </b>This is the last required math course needed in the Computer Science major! Yay no more math for me!!! But wait ... upon finishing this class I realized I have had a blast. This class was unlike anything I had taken before, it was not computational. We learned about math logic and proof writing. It was super cool! I have realized that I do not want to stop taking math. The Professor of this class is teaching a 400 level (highest level course) Geometry class next semester and he said I should take it, but to take the class I need Linear Algebra. He said that I can take Linear Algebra in conjunction with it. We'll see how registration goes but it looks like I am going to double up on math next semester. I never would have guessed I was going to go this route.</p>

<p class="classDesc"><b>REL 116: </b>This is a class that fulfills a requirement in the Liberal Arts graduation requirements. It was a very interesting class. I like low stakes intro classes like this and there were two professors who taught the course in conjunction so that was cool.</p>
